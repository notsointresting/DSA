Linear Search Algorithm
Algorithm:-
1) Create a variable position with the value 0
2) Check whether the number at index position in card equals query.
3) if it does, position is the answer and can be returned from the function.
4) if not, increment the value of position by 1 and repeat steps 2 to 5 till we reach the last position.
5) If the number was not found, return -1.

Algorithm is simply list of statements which can be converted into code and executed by computer on different sets of inputs.

-----
Binary Search Algorithm

1) Find the middle element of the list
2) If it matches queried number, return the middle positioon as the answer.
3) If it is less than the queried number, then search the first half of the list.
4) If it is greater than the queried number, then search the second half of the list.
5) If no more elements remain, return -1

TestCase analyze:-
nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12]
target = 9

Output = -1
Expected = 4


breaking down the code, to identify mistake.

left = 0
right = len(nums) -1 = 5

while 0 <= 6:
    mid = (4+4)//2
    mid_number = nums[mid] = num[4] = 9

    if 9 == 9:
        Yes it is.
        return the mid that is position.
    elif 5 < target:
        Yes it is,consider this list.
        nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12]
                L,     M   R
        L = mid + 1 = 4
    elif 12 > target:
        Yes it is,consider this list
        nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12]
                         L MR
        R = mid-1 = 4

if num not in list
return -1
